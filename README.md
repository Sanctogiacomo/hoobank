)

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Use the Hamburger menu
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

###
- Live Site URL: [Deployed App](https://hoobankingapp.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- Tailwind



### What I learned


```React.js
I learnt a lot from from this project. The ability to use props, useState and so on... 
```
```css
Using  the media query was bombshell.
I was able to how to use flexbox, grid, and much more. Thanks to resources online!
```

```JavaScript(Js)
I was able  to make use of Js object, spread operators, mapping, and ternery operators.
```  

### Continued development

Areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects: I would love to add some additional
features like signup, login and so on.
